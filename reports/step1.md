# REPORT ON FOOTSTEP 1: DESIGN A COURSE CONCEP

# 1. TON`S GOALS
To create the course concept and develop a learning plan on the next steps, we have relied on the objectives concerned the stakeholder’s priorities, such as:
* increase the number of applications  
* growth the  number of new projects 
* TON adoption  
* increase the number of daily active users (DAU)
* increase the activity in repositories
* increase the number of TON developers
* increase people's level of trust for TON
* increase the number of business and government organizations,that support TON blockchain in their processes (certificates, diplomas and other legally significant documents) 



# 2. COURSE INTRODUCTION 

##    2.1. NAME


Blockchain intro with samples on the TON ecosystem


##     2.2. FORMAT 


Massive open online course (MOOC) for Coursera / edX


MOOCs are open, large-scale web-based courses designed and delivered by higher education institutions and organizations in which anyone with a smart device and internet connection can participate, regardless of age, gender, geographic location, or education background.

Usually, they are open to anyone who registers. One single course may admit even thousands of students. They are open to anyone, regardless of whether or not they have studied before. During a MOOC, learners use a wide range of online media and interactive tools to interact with educators and other learners. This might include video lectures, articles, discussions and different assignments. MOOC students have access to discussions with other students, as well as forums and message boards. Learners can simply follow the course at their own pace, taking as much time as they need. Instead of face-to-face lectures or seminars, classes are recorded on video and materials are uploaded to the platform. Coursera and edX are the main platforms offering great MOOCs. We believe a massive open online course is [an excellent way](https://context.reverso.net/%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4/%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9/an+excellent+way) to expand TON awareness.


## 2.3. LANGUAGE 
The course will be created in English. All starting materials will be prepared  for further translation to any language.  \

## 2.4. DURATION
Course includes 4-6 modules that teach and evaluate clear learning objectives. Each module corresponds to one week in the course. Each module can be organized around 4-8 lessons, which are cohesive units of learning content.

Each module includes approximately 1.5 to 6 hours of learner engagement time (time spent watching videos, reading materials, completing practical assignments). 

## 2.5. TARGET AUDIENCE
We consider the target audience consists of:
    
* People with technical background and without knowledge and experience in blockchain and crypto
* TON followers, TON curious, TON investors, traders 
* Those who are aimed at getting involved in TON ecosystem projects
* Those who are going to develop TON ecosystem  projects

##     2.6. REQUIREMENTS TO THE LEARNERS


The basic requirements for students include:

* A general knowledge of computers and the Internet
* Basic financial literacy is helpful but not critical.

##     2.7.  PRINCIPALS 


To create a wildly successful online course, we are working by using the basic milestones of online course creation. You’ll find an overview of the 4 major principles:

* Course fractality. The same material is explained at the level of basic principles, further in detail, and then in the appendix to tools and useful actions.
* The material is explained with examples and metaphors that can be understood by listeners without deep immersion in crypto and financial instruments
* We use interactive stands in which people can get experience of interacting with real external tools. In the ideal case, this could be integration into real tools to test the acquired skills of the student, this could be a crypto wallet, crypto exchange, etc.
* From the course, further steps should be clear in which a person can be further converted



# 3. CONTENT DESCRIPTION 

Content provides background knowledge that will be necessary for understanding any blockchain project. Material has been selected with examples that can be understood by learners without deep immersion in crypto. We explain essential points at the level of basic principles and at the level of application specific tools of the TON ecosystem at the end of the learning. 


## 3.1. TYPES OF PRACTICAL ASSIGNMENTS 

We are going to implement following types of assignments in our course:


### **3.1.1. TEST**

We will use two types of tests: assessed and formative.

* The purpose of the** assessed tests** is to check if students have achieved the stated learning outcomes. With these tests you can summarize the main or intermediate results and give the students grades.
* The purpose of **formative tests **is to help students test themselves, practice, and remember the information they've learned. In other words, these tests teach students first and foremost.


### **3.1.2. PEER REVIEWS**

Peer review (PR)  is a task in which learners analyze and evaluate each other’s work.They provide qualitative and quantitative feedback to other learners in the course based on grading criteria. It is used in mass online courses to evaluate tasks with an open result - such as essays, design and creative projects.


### **3.1.3. TASKS **

Learners are suggested as well to take a practitioner part of the course with using the TON ecosystem tools and services , NFT, crypto exchanges, Web3 browsing, and others.  It takes place in order to get “TON ecosystem ready” status.


## 3.2. LEARNING ENVIRONMENT

Learning environment refers to the diverse conditions where learning takes place. It empowers students to effectively learn by doing practical activities and track their own progress.  

We refer to the online Learning environment for this course following parts: 


* **Learner and content**

Videos,  practical assignments, knowledge base (additional materials)

* **Learner and platform**

Coursera/edX learning platforms, TON ecosystem tools and services

* **Learner by himself**

Progress tracker, feedback surveys, self-paced education

* **Learner and others learners**

Community (forum) 

* **Learner and SMEs**

Community (forum)


## 3.3. LEARNING OUTCOMES


### 3.3.1. GENERAL COURSE OUTCOME

Learners will get background knowledge necessary for understanding any blockchain project. In addition, they become “TON ecosystem ready'' after finishing the course, as well  Learners will get to know how the development environment works related to the TON as well.
